    <p>Pythagoras and other philosophers of the time believed that because
    mathematical concepts were more "practical" (easier to regulate and classify)
    than physical ones, they had greater actuality. St. Augustine of Hippo
    (A.D. 354â€“430) wrote "Numbers are the Universal language offered by the
    deity to humans as confirmation of the truth." Similar to Pythagoras,
    he too believed that everything had numerical relationships and it was up
    to the mind to seek and investigate the secrets of these relationships or
    have them revealed by divine grace. - Wikipedia</p>
